                              1. ABSTRACT
================================================================================

The Railway Reservation System (RailServe 2025) is a comprehensive web-based 
application designed to modernize and streamline the railway ticket booking 
process. This system provides a user-friendly interface for passengers to 
search trains, book tickets, make payments, and manage their bookings 
efficiently. The application also includes a robust admin panel for railway 
administrators to manage trains, routes, stations, quotas, and monitor system 
performance.

Built using Flask web framework with Python, the system employs PostgreSQL 
database for reliable data storage and implements secure authentication 
mechanisms. The project demonstrates the practical application of software 
engineering principles, database management, and web development technologies 
to solve real-world transportation challenges.

================================================================================
                              2. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

2.1 BACKGROUND
--------------
Railway transportation is one of the most important modes of travel in many 
countries. With millions of passengers traveling daily, an efficient and 
reliable ticket reservation system is essential. Traditional ticket booking 
methods are time-consuming and often lead to long queues at railway stations.

Modern web-based reservation systems address these challenges by providing 
24/7 accessibility, real-time seat availability, secure payments, and instant 
ticket confirmation. This project aims to develop such a system with enhanced 
features and user experience.

2.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT
---------------------
The existing railway booking systems face several challenges:
- Long waiting times at ticket counters
- Lack of real-time seat availability information
- Manual waitlist management leading to inefficiencies
- Limited accessibility for users in remote areas
- Complex fare calculation and quota management
- Inefficient handling of cancellations and refunds

2.3 OBJECTIVES

1. To develop a user-friendly web application for railway ticket booking
2. To implement secure user authentication and authorization
3. To provide real-time train search and seat availability
4. To automate the waitlist management and seat allocation process
5. To integrate secure payment gateway for online transactions
6. To create a comprehensive admin panel for system management
7. To implement dynamic pricing and quota management
8. To generate digital tickets with QR codes for easy verification
9. To provide PNR enquiry and booking history features
10. To ensure data security and system reliability

2.4 SCOPE
