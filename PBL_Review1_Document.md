## Project Overview

**Project:** RailServe - Railway Reservation System  
**Review Phase:** Review 1  
**Status:** Core System Implementation Complete

## Problem Statement

Development of a web-based railway reservation system with modern user interface, real-time booking capabilities, and efficient management features.

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) with SQLAlchemy ORM
